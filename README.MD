# Advent of Code - Rust - 2024

This repository contains my solutions to this years [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024).

I am completing this challenge using the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) programming language. I am no expert in Rust, so I am challenging myself with this language decision. I am hoping that I can learn more about solving these puzzles using a functional programming perspective.

You can find the solutions for each day contained within their own folder under `src/bin`. Once I start using shared code between days, that will be in `src/lib.rs`.
